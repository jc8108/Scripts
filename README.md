# Scripts
Just a place to store simple scripts.

--AutoHash-- A python script that takes one arguement when you run it: the filepath of a file that you want to obtain the MD5 and SHA256 hashes of.
You can then supply it a hash that you have to compare it against what it came up with to verify that they are both the same. 


# Things
--PasswordChecker-- A python program that searches in a password dump (I used rockyou.txt) for a supplied password to see if it is in there.
BYOPD (bring your own password dump). 

--BreachDefense-- A python game that loops until 1 of 2 outcomes is achieved- the hackers destroy your network or you defeat all the hackers.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose! As of now it takes no input, more of an experiment to play around with classes.
